AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004141-0004834 disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004933-0005639 stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
AimeeMullins_2009P-0005639-0006581 rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped
AimeeMullins_2009P-0006581-0007519 senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0007622-0008535 see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0008632-0009505 i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0009505-0010405 and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973 uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123 you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties
AimeeMullins_2009P-0012123-0013544 when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using a thesaurus back then
AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951 i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866 i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844 went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066 unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484 so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618 it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658 and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260 we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172 hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922 always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689 to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481 you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277 and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020 these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802 on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947 but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783 as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551 but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101 the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235 our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940 my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675 so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443 and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316 implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171 is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267 as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512 but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316 and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135 and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215 adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754 there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624 or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591 disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937 we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929 and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108 so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370 wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401 embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903 this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110 to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391 conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587 is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872 maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438 i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166 now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197 there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509 achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925 their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968 there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886 and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684 they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905 and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720 have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363 oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262 it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565 typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478 and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339 had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593 whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417 and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299 medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204 and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166 and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197 see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578 and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571 and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170 see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360 comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566 there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107 here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565 and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492 they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408 and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483 this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361 the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998 and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273 that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111 if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291 that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332 has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658 and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry

AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973 uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123 you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties

AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951 i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866 i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844 went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066 unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484 so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618 it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658 and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260 we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172 hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922 always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689 to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481 you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277 and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020 these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802 on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947 but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783 as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551 but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101 the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235 our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940 my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675 so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443 and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316 implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171 is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267 as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512 but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316 and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135 and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215 adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754 there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624 or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591 disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937 we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929 and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108 so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370 wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401 embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903 this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110 to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391 conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587 is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872 maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438 i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166 now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197 there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509 achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925 their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968 there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886 and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684 they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905 and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720 have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363 oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262 it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565 typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478 and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339 had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593 whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417 and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299 medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204 and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166 and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197 see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578 and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571 and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170 see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360 comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566 there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107 here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565 and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492 they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408 and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483 this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361 the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998 and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273 that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111 if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291 that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332 has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658 and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004141-0004834 disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004933-0005639 stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
AimeeMullins_2009P-0005639-0006581 rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped
AimeeMullins_2009P-0006581-0007519 senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0007622-0008535 see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0008632-0009505 i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0009505-0010405 and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973 uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123 you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties
AimeeMullins_2009P-0012123-0013544 when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using a thesaurus back then
AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951 i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866 i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844 went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066 unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484 so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618 it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658 and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260 we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172 hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922 always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689 to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481 you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277 and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020 these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802 on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947 but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783 as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551 but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101 the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235 our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940 my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675 so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443 and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316 implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171 is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience

AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512 but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316 and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135 and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215 adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754 there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624 or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591 disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937 we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929 and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108 so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370 wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401 embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903 this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110 to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391 conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587 is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872 maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438 i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166 now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197 there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509 achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925 their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968 there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886 and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684 they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905 and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720 have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363 oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262 it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565 typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478 and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339 had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593 whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417 and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299 medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204 and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166 and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197 see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578 and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571 and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170 see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360 comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566 there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107 here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565 and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492 they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408 and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483 this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361 the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998 and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273 that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111 if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291 that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332 has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658 and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004141-0004834 disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004933-0005639 stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
AimeeMullins_2009P-0005639-0006581 rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped
AimeeMullins_2009P-0006581-0007519 senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0007622-0008535 see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0008632-0009505 i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0009505-0010405 and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973 uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123 you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties
AimeeMullins_2009P-0012123-0013544 when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using a thesaurus back then
AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951 i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866 i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844 went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066 unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484 so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618 it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658 and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260 we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172 hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922 always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689 to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481 you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277 and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020 these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802 on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947 but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783 as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551 but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101 the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235 our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940 my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675 so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443 and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316 implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171 is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267 as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512 but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316 and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135 and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215 adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754 there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624 or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591 disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937 we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929 and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108 so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370 wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401 embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903 this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110 to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391 conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587 is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872 maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438 i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166 now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197 there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509 achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925 their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968 there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886 and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684 they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905 and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720 have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363 oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262 it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565 typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478 and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339 had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593 whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417 and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299 medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204 and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166 and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197 see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578 and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571 and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170 see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360 comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566 there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107 here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565 and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492 they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408 and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483 this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361 the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998 and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273 that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111 if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291 that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332 has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658 and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004141-0004834 disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004933-0005639 stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
AimeeMullins_2009P-0005639-0006581 rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped
AimeeMullins_2009P-0006581-0007519 senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0007622-0008535 see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0008632-0009505 i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0009505-0010405 and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973 uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123 you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties
AimeeMullins_2009P-0012123-0013544 when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using a thesaurus back then
AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951 i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866 i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844 went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066 unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484 so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618 it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658 and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260 we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172 hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922 always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689 to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481 you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277 and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020 these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802 on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947 but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783 as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551 but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101 the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235 our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940 my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675 so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443 and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316 implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171 is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267 as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512 but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316 and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135 and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215 adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754 there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624 or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591 disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937 we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929 and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108 so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370 wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401 embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903 this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110 to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391 conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587 is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872 maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438 i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166 now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197 there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509 achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925 their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968 there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886 and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684 they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905 and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720 have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363 oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262 it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565 typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478 and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339 had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593 whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417 and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299 medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204 and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166 and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197 see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578 and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571 and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170 see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360 comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566 there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107 here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565 and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492 they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408 and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483 this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361 the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998 and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273 that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111 if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291 that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332 has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658 and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004141-0004834 disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004933-0005639 stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
AimeeMullins_2009P-0005639-0006581 rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped
AimeeMullins_2009P-0006581-0007519 senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0007622-0008535 see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0008632-0009505 i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0009505-0010405 and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973 uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123 you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties
AimeeMullins_2009P-0012123-0013544 when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using a thesaurus back then
AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951 i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866 i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844 went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066 unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484 so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618 it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658 and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260 we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172 hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922 always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689 to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481 you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277 and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020 these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802 on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947 but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783 as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551 but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101 the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235 our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940 my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675 so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443 and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316 implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171 is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267 as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512 but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316 and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135 and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215 adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754 there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624 or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591 disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937 we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929 and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108 so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370 wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401 embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903 this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110 to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391 conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587 is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872 maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438 i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166 now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197 there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509 achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925 their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968 there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886 and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684 they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905 and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720 have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363 oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262 it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565 typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478 and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339 had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593 whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417 and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299 medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204 and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166 and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197 see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578 and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571 and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170 see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360 comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566 there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107 here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565 and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492 they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408 and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483 this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361 the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998 and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273 that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111 if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291 that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child

AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry

AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123 you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties

AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866 i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844 went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066 unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484 so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618 it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658 and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260 we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172 hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922 always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689 to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481 you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277 and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020 these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802 on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947 but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783 as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551 but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101 the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235 our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940 my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675 so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443 and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316 implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171 is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267 as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512 but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316 and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135 and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215 adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754 there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624 or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591 disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937 we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929 and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108 so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370 wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401 embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903 this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110 to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391 conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587 is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872 maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438 i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166 now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197 there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509 achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925 their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968 there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886 and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684 they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905 and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720 have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363 oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262 it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565 typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478 and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339 had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593 whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417 and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299 medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204 and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166 and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197 see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578 and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571 and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170 see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360 comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566 there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107 here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565 and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492 they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408 and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483 this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361 the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998 and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273 that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111 if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291 that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332 has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658 and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004141-0004834 disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004933-0005639 stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
AimeeMullins_2009P-0005639-0006581 rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped
AimeeMullins_2009P-0006581-0007519 senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0007622-0008535 see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0008632-0009505 i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0009505-0010405 and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973 uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123 you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties
AimeeMullins_2009P-0012123-0013544 when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using a thesaurus back then
AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951 i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866 i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844 went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066 unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484 so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618 it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658 and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260 we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172 hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922 always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689 to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481 you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277 and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020 these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802 on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947 but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783 as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551 but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101 the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235 our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940 my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675 so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443 and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316 implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171 is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267 as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512 but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316 and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135 and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215 adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754 there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624 or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591 disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937 we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929 and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108 so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370 wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401 embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903 this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110 to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391 conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587 is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872 maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438 i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166 now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197 there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509 achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925 their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968 there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886 and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684 they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905 and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720 have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363 oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262 it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565 typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478 and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339 had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593 whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417 and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299 medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204 and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166 and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197 see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578 and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571 and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170 see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360 comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566 there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107 here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565 and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492 they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408 and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483 this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361 the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998 and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273 that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111 if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291 that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332 has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658 and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004141-0004834 disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004933-0005639 stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
AimeeMullins_2009P-0005639-0006581 rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped
AimeeMullins_2009P-0006581-0007519 senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0007622-0008535 see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0008632-0009505 i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0009505-0010405 and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973 uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123 you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties
AimeeMullins_2009P-0012123-0013544 when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using a thesaurus back then
AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951 i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866 i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844 went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066 unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484 so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618 it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658 and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260 we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172 hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922 always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689 to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481 you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277 and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020 these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802 on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947 but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783 as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551 but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101 the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235 our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940 my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675 so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443 and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316 implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171 is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267 as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512 but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316 and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135 and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215 adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754 there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624 or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591 disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937 we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929 and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108 so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370 wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401 embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903 this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110 to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391 conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587 is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872 maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438 i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166 now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197 there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509 achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925 their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968 there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886 and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684 they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905 and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720 have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363 oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262 it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565 typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478 and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339 had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593 whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417 and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299 medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204 and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166 and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197 see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578 and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571 and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170 see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360 comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566 there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107 here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565 and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492 they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408 and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483 this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361 the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998 and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273 that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111 if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291 that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332 has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658 and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004141-0004834 disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004933-0005639 stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
AimeeMullins_2009P-0005639-0006581 rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped
AimeeMullins_2009P-0006581-0007519 senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0007622-0008535 see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0008632-0009505 i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0009505-0010405 and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973 uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123 you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties
AimeeMullins_2009P-0012123-0013544 when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using a thesaurus back then
AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951 i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866 i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844 went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066 unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484 so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618 it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658 and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260 we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172 hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922 always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689 to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481 you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277 and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020 these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802 on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947 but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783 as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551 but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101 the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235 our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940 my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675 so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443 and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316 implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171 is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267 as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512 but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316 and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135 and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215 adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754 there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624 or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591 disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937 we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929 and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108 so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370 wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401 embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903 this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110 to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391 conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587 is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872 maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438 i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166 now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197 there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509 achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925 their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968 there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886 and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684 they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905 and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720 have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363 oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262 it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565 typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478 and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339 had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593 whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417 and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299 medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204 and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166 and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197 see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578 and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571 and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170 see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360 comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566 there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107 here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565 and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492 they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408 and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483 this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361 the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998 and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273 that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111 if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291 that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332 has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658 and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
AimeeMullins_2009P-0001782-0002881 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but
AimeeMullins_2009P-0002881-0004026 i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004141-0004834 disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked
AimeeMullins_2009P-0004933-0005639 stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated
AimeeMullins_2009P-0005639-0006581 rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped
AimeeMullins_2009P-0006581-0007519 senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0007622-0008535 see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0008632-0009505 i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0009505-0010405 and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010430-0010973 uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
AimeeMullins_2009P-0010973-0012123 you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties
AimeeMullins_2009P-0012123-0013544 when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using a thesaurus back then
AimeeMullins_2009P-0013544-0014951 i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today
AimeeMullins_2009P-0014951-0015866 i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately
AimeeMullins_2009P-0015866-0016844 went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry
AimeeMullins_2009P-0016844-0018066 unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018227-0018484 so it's not just about the words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0018484-0019618 it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0019618-0020658 and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse
AimeeMullins_2009P-0020658-0021408 verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence
AimeeMullins_2009P-0021558-0022537 so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered
AimeeMullins_2009P-0022596-0023219 by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0023219-0024260 we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead
AimeeMullins_2009P-0024260-0025318 one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo
AimeeMullins_2009P-0025318-0026172 hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026172-0026922 always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children
AimeeMullins_2009P-0026922-0027863 i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0027863-0028948 i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know
AimeeMullins_2009P-0028948-0029689 to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and
AimeeMullins_2009P-0029689-0030481 you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0030481-0031277 and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving
AimeeMullins_2009P-0031277-0032020 these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032020-0032956 i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0032956-0033802 on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward
AimeeMullins_2009P-0033802-0034947 but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0034947-0035686 and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0035686-0036783 as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future
AimeeMullins_2009P-0036783-0037485 this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0037485-0038551 but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want
AimeeMullins_2009P-0038551-0039101 the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0039227-0040235 our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint
AimeeMullins_2009P-0040235-0041940 my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0041940-0043192 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0043323-0044675 so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
AimeeMullins_2009P-0044776-0045808 and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people
AimeeMullins_2009P-0045808-0046227 have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity
AimeeMullins_2009P-0046227-0047443 and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why
AimeeMullins_2009P-0047443-0048316 implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness
AimeeMullins_2009P-0048316-0049171 is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience
AimeeMullins_2009P-0049171-0050267 as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0050267-0051512 but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing
AimeeMullins_2009P-0051512-0052435 adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0052435-0053316 and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0053316-0054135 and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is
AimeeMullins_2009P-0054135-0055215 adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0055215-0056279 so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0056279-0057375 and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt
AimeeMullins_2009P-0057375-0058754 there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled
AimeeMullins_2009P-0058754-0059916 and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions
AimeeMullins_2009P-0059916-0060664 in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis
AimeeMullins_2009P-0060664-0061624 or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0061624-0062591 disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0062591-0063563 serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person
AimeeMullins_2009P-0063563-0064440 by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have
AimeeMullins_2009P-0064440-0065937 we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0065937-0066929 and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0066929-0068108 so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities
AimeeMullins_2009P-0068108-0069370 wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0069586-0070401 embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0070569-0071687 and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0071687-0072903 this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character
AimeeMullins_2009P-0072903-0074110 to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change
AimeeMullins_2009P-0074110-0075391 conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish
AimeeMullins_2009P-0075391-0076587 is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest
AimeeMullins_2009P-0076587-0077977 human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power
AimeeMullins_2009P-0077977-0079016 so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079016-0079872 maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet
AimeeMullins_2009P-0079872-0080438 i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy
AimeeMullins_2009P-0080438-0081166 now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical
AimeeMullins_2009P-0081166-0082197 there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of
AimeeMullins_2009P-0082197-0083509 achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage
AimeeMullins_2009P-0083509-0084925 their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute
AimeeMullins_2009P-0084925-0085968 there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury
AimeeMullins_2009P-0085968-0086886 and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community
AimeeMullins_2009P-0086886-0087684 they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable
AimeeMullins_2009P-0087684-0088306 few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania
AimeeMullins_2009P-0088306-0089205 and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089205-0089905 and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir i don't
AimeeMullins_2009P-0089905-0090720 have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb
AimeeMullins_2009P-0090720-0091363 oh that guy and but of course actually
AimeeMullins_2009P-0091363-0092262 it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course
AimeeMullins_2009P-0092262-0093565 typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents
AimeeMullins_2009P-0093565-0094478 and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger
AimeeMullins_2009P-0094478-0095339 had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
AimeeMullins_2009P-0095339-0096121 and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since
AimeeMullins_2009P-0096939-0097577 the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood
AimeeMullins_2009P-0097577-0098593 whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories
AimeeMullins_2009P-0098593-0099417 and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann
AimeeMullins_2009P-0099417-0100299 medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will
AimeeMullins_2009P-0100299-0101128 no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life
AimeeMullins_2009P-0101128-0102204 and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise
AimeeMullins_2009P-0102204-0103166 and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve
AimeeMullins_2009P-0103166-0104197 see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it
AimeeMullins_2009P-0104197-0105578 and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second
AimeeMullins_2009P-0105578-0106539 i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure
AimeeMullins_2009P-0106539-0107571 and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0107571-0109070 and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me
AimeeMullins_2009P-0109070-0110170 see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key
AimeeMullins_2009P-0110170-0111240 to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense
AimeeMullins_2009P-0111240-0112174 you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate
AimeeMullins_2009P-0112174-0113360 comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0113542-0114566 there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking
AimeeMullins_2009P-0114566-0115107 here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on
AimeeMullins_2009P-0115107-0116565 and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period
AimeeMullins_2009P-0116565-0117492 they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students
AimeeMullins_2009P-0117492-0118408 and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out
AimeeMullins_2009P-0118639-0119483 this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too
AimeeMullins_2009P-0119483-0120361 the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120361-0120998 and treating them so i think
AimeeMullins_2009P-0120998-0121273 that the only true disability
AimeeMullins_2009P-0121273-0122382 is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty
AimeeMullins_2009P-0122382-0123096 it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine
AimeeMullins_2009P-0123285-0124111 if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124111-0124794 to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well
AimeeMullins_2009P-0124794-0125680 when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being
AimeeMullins_2009P-0125680-0126334 i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz
AimeeMullins_2009P-0126334-0127291 that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child
AimeeMullins_2009P-0127291-0128332 has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words
AimeeMullins_2009P-0128332-0129658 and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you miss them i want to start with what i call the official dogma
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 the official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from ma bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones these are cell phones of the future
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you well we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and these risks b has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you want to be in with respect to marriage and family
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and i assign twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where the hi wifi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 cell phone call should i respond to this email should i draft this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here is an example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you who aren't new yorkers i apologize
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well damn it this guy is thinking it's august
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away i could be parking right in front of my building
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my jeans i wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 you know i want a pair of jeans here's my size and the shopkeeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid washed do you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt worse why i wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself the reason is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very low exp i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors damn it one of them should've been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 cause if they did
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you wouldn't all know what this was about the truth is more like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that this stuff is as good as you expect it to be
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively and we feel worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice there's some magical amount i don't know what it is i'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 where the their problem is not that they have too much choice their problem is that they have too little so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants child seats don't help
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 not only would those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also this is what economists call a pareto improving move income redistribution will make everyone
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us so to conclude
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 you're supposed to read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person say ah what does this fish know you know nothing is possible in this fishbowl
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you don't have freedom you have paralysis
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody needs a fishbowl this one is almost certainly too limited
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 perhaps even for the fish certainly for us but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and i suspect disaster thank you very much
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you miss them i want to start with what i call the official dogma
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 the official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from ma bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones these are cell phones of the future
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you well we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and these risks b has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you want to be in with respect to marriage and family
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and i assign twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where the hi wifi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 cell phone call should i respond to this email should i draft this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here is an example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you who aren't new yorkers i apologize
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well damn it this guy is thinking it's august
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away i could be parking right in front of my building
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my jeans i wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 you know i want a pair of jeans here's my size and the shopkeeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid washed do you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt worse why i wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself the reason is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very low exp i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors damn it one of them should've been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 cause if they did
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you wouldn't all know what this was about the truth is more like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that this stuff is as good as you expect it to be
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively and we feel worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice there's some magical amount i don't know what it is i'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 where the their problem is not that they have too much choice their problem is that they have too little so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants child seats don't help
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 not only would those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also this is what economists call a pareto improving move income redistribution will make everyone
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us so to conclude
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 you're supposed to read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person say ah what does this fish know you know nothing is possible in this fishbowl
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you don't have freedom you have paralysis
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody needs a fishbowl this one is almost certainly too limited
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 perhaps even for the fish certainly for us but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and i suspect disaster thank you very much
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you miss them i want to start with what i call the official dogma
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 the official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from ma bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones these are cell phones of the future
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you well we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and these risks b has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you want to be in with respect to marriage and family
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and i assign twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where the hi wifi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 cell phone call should i respond to this email should i draft this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here is an example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you who aren't new yorkers i apologize
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well damn it this guy is thinking it's august
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away i could be parking right in front of my building
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my jeans i wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 you know i want a pair of jeans here's my size and the shopkeeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid washed do you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt worse why i wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself the reason is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very low exp i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors damn it one of them should've been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 cause if they did
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you wouldn't all know what this was about the truth is more like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that this stuff is as good as you expect it to be
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively and we feel worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice there's some magical amount i don't know what it is i'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 where the their problem is not that they have too much choice their problem is that they have too little so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants child seats don't help
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 not only would those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also this is what economists call a pareto improving move income redistribution will make everyone
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us so to conclude
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 you're supposed to read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person say ah what does this fish know you know nothing is possible in this fishbowl
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you don't have freedom you have paralysis
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody needs a fishbowl this one is almost certainly too limited
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 perhaps even for the fish certainly for us but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and i suspect disaster thank you very much
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you miss them i want to start with what i call the official dogma
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 the official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from ma bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones these are cell phones of the future
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you well we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and these risks b has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you want to be in with respect to marriage and family
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and i assign twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where the hi wifi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 cell phone call should i respond to this email should i draft this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here is an example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you who aren't new yorkers i apologize
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well damn it this guy is thinking it's august
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away i could be parking right in front of my building
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my jeans i wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 you know i want a pair of jeans here's my size and the shopkeeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid washed do you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better

BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very low exp i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors damn it one of them should've been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this

BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively and we feel worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice there's some magical amount i don't know what it is i'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 where the their problem is not that they have too much choice their problem is that they have too little so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants child seats don't help
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 not only would those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also this is what economists call a pareto improving move income redistribution will make everyone
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us so to conclude
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 you're supposed to read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person say ah what does this fish know you know nothing is possible in this fishbowl
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you don't have freedom you have paralysis
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody needs a fishbowl this one is almost certainly too limited
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 perhaps even for the fish certainly for us but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and i suspect disaster thank you very much
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you miss them i want to start with what i call the official dogma
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 the official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from ma bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones these are cell phones of the future
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you well we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and these risks b has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you want to be in with respect to marriage and family
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and i assign twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where the hi wifi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 cell phone call should i respond to this email should i draft this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here is an example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you who aren't new yorkers i apologize
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well damn it this guy is thinking it's august
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away i could be parking right in front of my building
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my jeans i wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 you know i want a pair of jeans here's my size and the shopkeeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid washed do you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt worse why i wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself the reason is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very low exp i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors damn it one of them should've been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 cause if they did
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you wouldn't all know what this was about the truth is more like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that this stuff is as good as you expect it to be
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively and we feel worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice there's some magical amount i don't know what it is i'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them

BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants child seats don't help
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 not only would those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also this is what economists call a pareto improving move income redistribution will make everyone
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us so to conclude

BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you miss them i want to start with what i call the official dogma

BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from ma bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones these are cell phones of the future
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you well we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and these risks b has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you want to be in with respect to marriage and family
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and i assign twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where the hi wifi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 cell phone call should i respond to this email should i draft this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here is an example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you who aren't new yorkers i apologize
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well damn it this guy is thinking it's august
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away i could be parking right in front of my building
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my jeans i wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 you know i want a pair of jeans here's my size and the shopkeeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid washed do you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt worse why i wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself the reason is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very low exp i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors damn it one of them should've been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 cause if they did
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you wouldn't all know what this was about the truth is more like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that this stuff is as good as you expect it to be
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively and we feel worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice there's some magical amount i don't know what it is i'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 where the their problem is not that they have too much choice their problem is that they have too little so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants child seats don't help
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 not only would those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also this is what economists call a pareto improving move income redistribution will make everyone
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us so to conclude
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 you're supposed to read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person say ah what does this fish know you know nothing is possible in this fishbowl
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you don't have freedom you have paralysis
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody needs a fishbowl this one is almost certainly too limited
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 perhaps even for the fish certainly for us but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and i suspect disaster thank you very much
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you miss them i want to start with what i call the official dogma
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 the official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from ma bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones these are cell phones of the future
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you well we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and these risks b has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you want to be in with respect to marriage and family
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and i assign twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where the hi wifi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 cell phone call should i respond to this email should i draft this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here is an example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you who aren't new yorkers i apologize
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well damn it this guy is thinking it's august
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away i could be parking right in front of my building
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my jeans i wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 you know i want a pair of jeans here's my size and the shopkeeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid washed do you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt worse why i wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself the reason is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very low exp i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors damn it one of them should've been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 cause if they did
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you wouldn't all know what this was about the truth is more like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that this stuff is as good as you expect it to be
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively and we feel worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice there's some magical amount i don't know what it is i'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 where the their problem is not that they have too much choice their problem is that they have too little so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants child seats don't help
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 not only would those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also this is what economists call a pareto improving move income redistribution will make everyone
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us so to conclude
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 you're supposed to read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person say ah what does this fish know you know nothing is possible in this fishbowl
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you don't have freedom you have paralysis
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody needs a fishbowl this one is almost certainly too limited
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 perhaps even for the fish certainly for us but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and i suspect disaster thank you very much
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you miss them i want to start with what i call the official dogma
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 the official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from ma bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones these are cell phones of the future
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you well we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and these risks b has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you want to be in with respect to marriage and family
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and i assign twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where the hi wifi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 cell phone call should i respond to this email should i draft this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to

BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you who aren't new yorkers i apologize
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well damn it this guy is thinking it's august
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away i could be parking right in front of my building

BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my jeans i wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 you know i want a pair of jeans here's my size and the shopkeeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid washed do you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt worse why i wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself the reason is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very low exp i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors damn it one of them should've been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 cause if they did
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you wouldn't all know what this was about the truth is more like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that this stuff is as good as you expect it to be
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively and we feel worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice there's some magical amount i don't know what it is i'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 where the their problem is not that they have too much choice their problem is that they have too little so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants child seats don't help
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 not only would those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also this is what economists call a pareto improving move income redistribution will make everyone
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us so to conclude
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 you're supposed to read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person say ah what does this fish know you know nothing is possible in this fishbowl
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you don't have freedom you have paralysis
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody needs a fishbowl this one is almost certainly too limited
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 perhaps even for the fish certainly for us but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and i suspect disaster thank you very much
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you miss them i want to start with what i call the official dogma
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 the official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from ma bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones these are cell phones of the future
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you well we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and these risks b has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you want to be in with respect to marriage and family
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and i assign twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where the hi wifi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 cell phone call should i respond to this email should i draft this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here is an example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you who aren't new yorkers i apologize
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well damn it this guy is thinking it's august
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away i could be parking right in front of my building
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my jeans i wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 you know i want a pair of jeans here's my size and the shopkeeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid washed do you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt worse why i wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself the reason is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very low exp i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors damn it one of them should've been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 cause if they did
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you wouldn't all know what this was about the truth is more like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that this stuff is as good as you expect it to be
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively and we feel worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none

BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 where the their problem is not that they have too much choice their problem is that they have too little so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants child seats don't help
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 not only would those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also this is what economists call a pareto improving move income redistribution will make everyone
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us so to conclude
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 you're supposed to read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person say ah what does this fish know you know nothing is possible in this fishbowl
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you don't have freedom you have paralysis
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody needs a fishbowl this one is almost certainly too limited
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 perhaps even for the fish certainly for us but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and i suspect disaster thank you very much
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001224-0001955 i'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you've already heard and i'll try to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0001955-0002689 make some connections myself in case you miss them i want to start with what i call the official dogma
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0002689-0003874 the official dogma of what the official dogma of all western industrial societies and the official dogma runs like this if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0003874-0004912 the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0004912-0006224 valuable worthwhile essential to being human and because if people have freedom then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare and no one has to decide on our behalf
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0006224-0007545 the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice the more choice people have the more freedom they have and the more freedom they have the more welfare they have
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0007545-0008962 this i think is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it and it's also deeply embedded in our lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0008962-0009855 i'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us this is my supermarket not such a big one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0009855-0010532 i want to say just a word about salad dressing a hundred and seventy five salad dressings in my supermarket if you don't count
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0010532-0011842 the ten extra virgin olive oils and twelve balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings in the off chance that none of the hundred seventy five the store has on offer suit you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0011842-0012947 so this is what the supermarket is like and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers cd player tape player tuner amplifier and in this one
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0012947-0013956 single consumer electronics store there are that many stereo systems we can construct six and a half million
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0013956-0015043 different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store you've got to admit that's a lot of choice in other domains the world of communications
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0015043-0016393 there was a time when i was a boy when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted as long as it came from ma bell you rented your phone you didn't buy it one consequence of that by the way is that the phone never broke and
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0016393-0017265 those days are gone we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones especially in the world of cell phones these are cell phones of the future
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0017265-0017960 my favorite is the middle one the mp three player nose hair trimmer and creme brulee torch and if
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0018189-0019251 if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet you can rest assured that one day soon you will and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0019251-0020164 and do you know what the answer to this question now is the answer is no it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much so
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0020164-0021506 in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0021506-0022404 go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do instead you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you well we could do a or we could do b a has these benefits
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0022404-0023325 and these risks b has these benefits and these risks what do you want to do and you say doc what should i do and the doc says
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0023325-0024559 a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks what do you want to do and you say if you were me doc what would you do and the doc says but i'm not you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0024559-0026795 and the result is we call it patient autonomy which makes it sound like a good thing but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely the patient there's enormous marketing of prescription drugs
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0026795-0028208 to people like you and me which if you think about it makes no sense at all since we can't buy them why do they market to us if we can't buy them the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask our prescriptions to be changed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0028208-0029108 something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice as this slide
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0029108-0030333 is meant to indicate we get to we don't inherit an identity we get to invent it and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like and that means that every day when you wake up in the morning you have to decide what kind of person
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030333-0030923 you want to be in with respect to marriage and family
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0030923-0032176 there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could and then you started having kids as soon as you could the only real choice was who
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0032176-0033102 not when and not what you did after nowadays everything is very much up for grabs i teach wonderfully intelligent students
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0033102-0034166 and i assign twenty percent less work than i used to and it's not because they're less smart and it's not because they're less diligent it's because they are preoccupied
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034166-0034940 asking themselves should i get married or not should i get married now should i get married later should i have kids first or a career first
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0034940-0036185 all of these are consuming questions and they're going to answer these questions whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses and indeed they should these are important questions to answer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036404-0036516 work
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0036516-0037766 we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0038294-0039241 there is one corner by the way that i'm not going to tell anybody about where you actually where the where the hi wifi works i'm not telling you about it because i want to use it
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0039241-0040156 so what this means this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work is that we have to make a decision again and again and again about whether
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0040156-0041465 we should or shouldn't be working we can go to watch our kid play soccer and we have our cell phone on one hip and our blackberry on our other hip and our laptop presumably on our laps and even if they're all shut off
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0041465-0042097 every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game we are also asking ourselves should i answer this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0042097-0043255 cell phone call should i respond to this email should i draft this letter and even if the answer to the question is no it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0043255-0044538 so everywhere we look big things and small things material things and lifestyle things life is a matter of choice and the world we used to live in looked like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0044742-0045623 that is to say there were some choices but not everything was a matter of choice and the world we now live in looks like this and the question is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0045623-0046263 is this good news or bad news and the answer is yes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0046554-0047602 we all know what's good about it so i'm going to talk about what's bad about it all of this choice has two effects two negative effects on people
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0047602-0048920 one effect paradoxically is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation with so many options to choose from people find it very difficult to choose at all
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0048920-0050062 i'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans a colleague of mine got access to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0050177-0051115 investment records from vanguard the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about two thousand different workplaces and what she found is that
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051115-0051894 for every ten mutual funds the employer offered rate of participation went down two percent
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0051894-0054066 you offer fifty funds ten percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five why because with fifty funds to choose from it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow and then tomorrow and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and of course tomorrow never comes
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0054066-0055420 understand that not only does this mean that people are gonna have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0055420-0056869 by not participating they are passing up as much as five thousand dollars a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices and i think it makes the world look like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0057498-0058253 you really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity right you don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or even the wrong salad dressing
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0058253-0059016 so that's one effect the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0059016-0060008 we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from and there are several reasons for this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0060008-0061247 one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from if you buy one and it's not perfect and you know what salad dressing is it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0061247-0062516 and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made even if it was a good decision
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0062516-0063239 the more options there are the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0063239-0064442 second what economists call opportunity costs dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how how much the the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0064442-0065375 well when there are lots of alternatives to consider it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0065517-0066069 that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen here is an example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066069-0066421 for those of you who aren't new yorkers i apologize
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0066421-0067741 but here's what you're supposed to be thinking here's this couple on the hamptons very expensive real estate gorgeous beach beautiful day they have it all to themselves what could be better well damn it this guy is thinking it's august
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0067741-0068445 everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away i could be parking right in front of my building
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0068445-0069441 and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity day after day to have a great parking space
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0069441-0070466 opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose even when what we choose is terrific and the more options there are to consider
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0070466-0071150 the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs here's another example
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0071609-0072731 now now this cartoon makes a lot of points it makes points about living in the moment as well and probably about doing things slowly but one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing you're
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0072731-0073478 choosing not to do other things and those other things may have lots of attractive features and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive third
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0073478-0074419 escalation of expectations this hit me when i went to replace my jeans i wear jeans almost all the time and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0074419-0075648 and you bought them and they fit like crap and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times they started to feel feel ok so i went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones and i said i
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0075648-0077665 you know i want a pair of jeans here's my size and the shopkeeper said do you want slim fit easy fit relaxed fit you want button fly or zipper fly you want stonewashed or acid washed do you want them distressed you want boot cut you want tapered blah blah blah on and on he went my jaw dropped and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078109-0078372 he had no idea what that was
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0078372-0079678 so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans and i walked out of the store truth with the best fitting jeans i had ever had i did better all this choice made it possible for me to do better
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0079678-0080552 but i felt worse why i wrote a whole book to try and explain this to myself the reason is
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0080992-0082076 the reason i felt worse is that with all of these options available my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0082076-0083475 i had very low exp i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor when they came in a hundred flavors damn it one of them should've been perfect and what i got was good but it wasn't perfect and so i compared what i got to what i expected
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0083475-0084041 and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected adding options to people's lives
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0084041-0085502 can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be and what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results even when they're good results nobody in the world of marketing knows this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085502-0085781 cause if they did
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0085781-0086326 you wouldn't all know what this was about the truth is more like this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0086674-0087775 the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0087775-0088887 nowadays the world we live in we affluent industrialized citizens with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that this stuff is as good as you expect it to be
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0088887-0090231 you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations my expectations have gone through the roof the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0091167-0092769 i want to say just a little autobiographical moment that i i actually am married to a wife and and she's really quite wonderful i couldn't have done better i didn't settle but settling isn't always such a bad thing finally
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0092769-0094116 one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why who's responsible the answer is clear the world is responsible what could you do
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0094116-0095401 when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available and you buy one that is disappointing and you ask why who's responsible it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0095401-0096794 you could have done better with a thous with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display there is no excuse for failure and so when people make decisions and even though though the results of the decisions are good they feel disappointed
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0096794-0099151 about them they blame themselves clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation i believe a significant not the only but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves they think they're at fault
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099151-0099870 and so the net result is that we do better and in general objectively and we feel worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0099870-0100615 so let me remind you this is the official dogma the one that we all take to be true
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0100615-0101431 and it's all false it is not true there's no question that some choice is better than none
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0101431-0102631 but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice there's some magical amount i don't know what it is i'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0102631-0103651 our welfare now as a policy matter i'm almost done as a policy matter the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0103651-0104500 in industrial societies is material affluence there are lots of places in the world and we have heard about several of them
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0104500-0105476 where the their problem is not that they have too much choice their problem is that they have too little so the stuff i'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0105483-0106567 affluent western societies and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this steve levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult to install
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0106690-0107078 infants child seats don't help
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0107078-0108308 it's a waste of money what i'm telling you is that these expensive complicated choices it's not simply that they don't help they actually hurt they actually make us worse
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0108308-0109445 off if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0109445-0110503 not only would those people's lives be improved but ours would be improved also this is what economists call a pareto improving move income redistribution will make everyone
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0110503-0111279 better off not just poor people because of how all this excess choice plagues us so to conclude
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0111279-0112192 you're supposed to read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person say ah what does this fish know you know nothing is possible in this fishbowl
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0112295-0113151 impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0113151-0114308 fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you don't have freedom you have paralysis
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0114308-0115008 if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115008-0115842 you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody needs a fishbowl this one is almost certainly too limited
BarrySchwartz_2005G-0115842-0116905 perhaps even for the fish certainly for us but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and i suspect disaster thank you very much
