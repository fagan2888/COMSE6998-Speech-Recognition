I'M INVOLVED IN OTHER THINGS BESIDES
PHYSICS IN FACT MOSTLY NOW IN OTHER THINGS  ONE THING IS DISTANT RELATIONSHIPS AMONG HUMAN LANGUAGES  AND THE PROFESSIONAL
HISTORICAL LINGUISTS IN THE U S AND IN WESTERN EUROPE
MOSTLY TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM ANY LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS BIG GROUPINGS GROUPINGS THAT GO BACK
A LONG TIME LONGER THAN THE FAMILIAR FAMILIES THEY DON'T LIKE THAT THEY THINK IT'S CRANK  I DON'T THINK IT'S CRANK
AND THERE ARE SOME BRILLIANT LINGUISTS MOSTLY RUSSIANS  WHO ARE WORKING ON THAT AT SANTA FE INSTITUTE AND IN MOSCOW
AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE WHERE THAT LEADS
DOES IT REALLY LEAD TO A SINGLE ANCESTOR
SOME
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO  AND WHAT IF WE GO BACK BEYOND THAT SINGLE ANCESTOR  WHEN THERE WAS PRESUMABLY A COMPETITION AMONG MANY
LANGUAGES  HOW FAR BACK DOES THAT GO  HOW FAR BACK DOES MODERN LANGUAGE GO
HOW MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS DOES IT GO BACK CHRIS ANDERSON DO YOU HAVE A HUNCH OR A HOPE FOR WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT
MODERN LANGUAGE MUST BE OLDER THAN THE CAVE PAINTINGS AND CAVE ENGRAVINGS AND CAVE SCULPTURES AND DANCE STEPS IN THE IN THE SOFT CLAY IN THE CAVES IN WESTERN EUROPE IN THE AURIGNACIAN PERIOD SOME
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO  OR EARLIER
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID ALL THOSE THINGS AND DIDN'T ALSO HAVE A MODERN LANGUAGE SO I WOULD GUESS THAT THE ACTUAL ORIGIN GOES BACK AT LEAST THAT FAR AND MAYBE FURTHER
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL OR MANY OR MOST OF TODAY'S ATTESTED LANGUAGES COULDN'T DESCEND PERHAPS FROM ONE THAT'S MUCH YOUNGER THAN THAT LIKE SAY TWENTY THOUSAND YEARS OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND IT
WHAT WE CALL A BOTTLENECK
