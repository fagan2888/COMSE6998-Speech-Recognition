THE FIRST THING I REMEMBER KNOWIN'
WAS A LONESOME WHISTLE BLOWIN'
AND A YOUNG UN'S DREAM OF GROWIN' UP TO RIDE
ON A FREIGHT TRAIN LEAVIN' TOWN
NOT KNOWIN' WHERE I'M BOUND
AND NO ONE COULD CHANGE MY MIND BUT MAMA TRIED
ONE AND ONLY REBEL CHILD
FROM A FAMILY, MEEK AND MILD
MY MAMA SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT LAY IN STORE
DESPITE ALL MY SUNDAY LEARNIN'
TOWARDS THE BAD, I KEPT ON TURNIN'
'TIL MAMA COULDN'T HOLD ME ANYMORE
AND I TURNED TWENTY-ONE IN PRISON DOIN' LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE
NO ONE COULD STEER ME RIGHT BUT MAMA TRIED, MAMA TRIED
MAMA TRIED TO RAISE ME BETTER, BUT HER PLEADING, I DENIED
THAT LEAVES ONLY ME TO BLAME 'CAUSE MAMA TRIED
DEAR OLD DADDY, REST HIS SOUL
LEFT MY MOM A HEAVY LOAD
SHE TRIED SO VERY HARD TO FILL HIS SHOES
WORKIN' HOURS WITHOUT REST
WANTED ME TO HAVE THE BEST
SHE TRIED TO RAISE ME RIGHT BUT I REFUSED
AND I TURNED TWENTY-ONE IN PRISON DOIN' LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE
NO ONE COULD STEER ME RIGHT BUT MAMA TRIED, MAMA TRIED
MAMA TRIED TO RAISE ME BETTER, BUT HER PLEADING, I DENIED
THAT LEAVES ONLY ME TO BLAME 'CAUSE MAMA TRIED
